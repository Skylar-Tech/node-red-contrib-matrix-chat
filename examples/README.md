# Examples
These are examples of what is possible with the [node-red-contrib-matrix-chat](https://github.com/Skylar-Tech/node-red-contrib-matrix-chat) module for [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)

If you want to try any of them out just copy their JSON contents from their .json file and use the hamburger menu in Node-RED to import the flow.

Build something cool with these nodes? Feel free to submit a pull request to share it!

### Create user using Synapse v1 API

[View JSON](create-user-synapse-v1-api.json)

Use this flow to create users on servers with closed registration. You also use this endpoint to create your first admin user as it is the same as running the local python script on the server. This requires your registration secret from your homeserver.yaml Synapse server configuration file.

Edit the object on the inject node to the user/pass combo you want to create and hit the inject button (to the left of the inject node).

**Note:** This only works on Synapse servers.

### Respond to "image" with an uploaded image

[View JSON](respond-image-with-image.json)

You will need an image on the machine running Node-RED. In this case example.png exists inside the Node-RED directory.

### Respond to "file" with an uploaded file

[View JSON](respond-file-with-file.json)

You will need a file on the machine running Node-RED. In this case sample.pdf exists inside the Node-RED directory.

### Respond to "users" with full list of server users

This requires admin privileges.

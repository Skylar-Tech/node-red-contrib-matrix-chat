# Examples
These are examples of what is possible with the [node-red-contrib-matrix-chat](https://github.com/Skylar-Tech/node-red-contrib-matrix-chat) module for [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)

If you want to try any of them out just copy their JSON contents from their .json file and use the hamburger menu in Node-RED to import the flow.

Build something cool with these nodes? Feel free to submit a pull request to share it!

### Create user with Shared Secret Registration

[View JSON](shared-secret-registration.json)

Use this flow to create users on servers with closed registration. You also use this endpoint to create your first admin user as it is the same as running the local python script on the server. This requires your registration secret from your homeserver.yaml Synapse server configuration file.

Edit the object on the inject node to the user/pass combo you want to create and hit the inject button (to the left of the inject node).

**Note:** This only works on Synapse servers.

### Create/Edit Synapse User

[View JSON](add-user-with-admin-user.json)

Allows an administrator to create or modify a user account with a specified `msg.userId`.

### Use function node to run any command

[View JSON](custom-redact-function-node.json)

If we do not have a node for something you want to do (such as redacting events/messages) you can do this manually with a function node.

**Note:** You should make sure to catch any errors in your function node otherwise you could cause Node-RED to crash.

To view what sort of functions you have access to check out the `client.ts` file from `matrix-js-sdk` [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/master/src/client.ts).

### Respond to "ping" with "pong"

[View JSON](respond-to-html-with-html.json)

Use this flow to respond to anyone that says "ping" with "pong" into the same room.

### Respond to "html" with an HTML message

[View JSON](respond-to-html-with-html.json)

Use this flow to respond to anyone that says "html" with an example HTML message. This shows how easy it is to send HTML.

### Respond to "image" with an uploaded image

[View JSON](respond-image-with-image.json)

You will need an image on the machine running Node-RED. In this case example.png exists inside the Node-RED directory.

### Respond to "file" with an uploaded file

[View JSON](respond-file-with-file.json)

You will need a file on the machine running Node-RED. In this case sample.pdf exists inside the Node-RED directory.

### Respond to "react" with a reaction

[View JSON](respond-react-with-reaction.json)

Give a üëç reaction when someone says "react"

![img.png](respond-react-with-reaction.png)



### Respond to "users" with full list of server users

[View JSON](respond-users-list.json)

When someone sends the text "users" they get a HTML message back containing all the current users on the server.

This requires admin privileges.

### User Management

<details>
<summary>Get or set current user display name</summary>

[View JSON](get-set-displayname.json)

This flow lets you get or set the displayname for the current user.

![get-set-displayname.png](get-set-displayname.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Set user avatar using URL</summary>

[View JSON](set-avatar-from-url.json)

Inject a URL to an image and Node-RED will fetch the contents, upload to matrix, then set the user avatar to the new mxc_url.

This is a good example of how to use the upload file node.

![set-avatar-from-url.png](set-avatar-from-url.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fetch user info by userId</summary>

[View JSON](get-user.json)

Note this only works for users that the bot shares a room with. It will attempt to fetch the user from local storage first and if not found will query the server for the data.

![get-user.png](get-user.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create User with Shared Secret Registration</summary>

[View JSON](shared-secret-registration.json)

Use this flow to create users on servers with closed registration. You can also use this endpoint to create your first admin user, as it is the same as running the local Python script on the server. This requires your registration secret from your `homeserver.yaml` Synapse server configuration file.

**Instructions:**

1. Edit the object on the inject node to specify the desired username and password.
2. Click the inject button (to the left of the inject node) to create the user.

**Note:** This only works on Synapse servers.

![Shared Secret Registration](shared-secret-registration.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create/Edit Synapse User</summary>

[View JSON](add-user-with-admin-user.json)

Allows an administrator to create or modify a user account with a specified `msg.userId`.

![Create/Edit Synapse User](add-user-with-admin-user.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Deactivate User</summary>

[View JSON](deactivate-user.json)

If you send "deactivate_user @test:example.com", the bot will deactivate the `@test:example.com` account on the server.

**Note:**

- This requires the bot to be a server admin.
- **WARNING:** Accounts that are deleted cannot be restored. If you want to temporarily disable a user, consider modifying the user instead.

![Deactivate User](deactivate-user.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Force User to Join Room</summary>

[View JSON](force-join-room.json)

If you send "force_join @test:example.com !320j90mf0394f:example.com", the bot will force the user `@test:example.com` into room `!320j90mf0394f:example.com`.

**Note:**

- This requires the bot to be a server admin.
- This only works for rooms on the same server.

### Advanced Features

<details>
<summary>Use Function Node to Run Any Command</summary>

[View JSON](custom-redact-function-node.json)

If there isn't a node for something you want to do, you can use a function node to manually execute commands. For example, you can redact events (remove messages).

**Instructions:**

- Use the function node to write custom commands using the `matrix-js-sdk` client.
- Make sure to catch any errors in your function node to prevent Node-RED from crashing.

To view the available functions, check out the [`client.ts` file from `matrix-js-sdk`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/master/src/client.ts).

![Use Function Node to Run Commands](custom-redact-function-node.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Download & Store All Received Files/Images</summary>

[View JSON](store-received-files.json)

Downloads received files/images. If the file is encrypted, it will decrypt it for you. The decrypt node downloads the file; otherwise, you need to use an HTTP Request node to download the file.

**Instructions:**

- You may need to edit the storage directory for this to work.
- By default, files are saved in a `downloads` folder in the Node-RED directory.
- Ensure that Node-RED has permission to write to the specified directory.

## User Management

### Create User with Shared Secret Registration

[View JSON](shared-secret-registration.json)

Use this flow to create users on servers with closed registration. You can also use this endpoint to create your first admin user, as it is the same as running the local Python script on the server. This requires your registration secret from your `homeserver.yaml` Synapse server configuration file.

**Instructions:**

1. Edit the object on the inject node to specify the desired username and password.
2. Click the inject button (to the left of the inject node) to create the user.

**Note:** This only works on Synapse servers.

### Create/Edit Synapse User

[View JSON](add-user-with-admin-user.json)

Allows an administrator to create or modify a user account with a specified `msg.userId`.

![Create/Edit Synapse User](add-user-with-admin-user.png)

### Deactivate User

[View JSON](deactivate-user.json)

If you send "deactivate_user @test:example.com", the bot will deactivate the `@test:example.com` account on the server.

**Note:**

- This requires the bot to be a server admin.
- **WARNING:** Accounts that are deleted cannot be restored. If you want to temporarily disable a user, consider modifying the user instead.

### Force User to Join Room

[View JSON](force-join-room.json)

If you send "force_join @test:example.com !320j90mf0394f:example.com", the bot will force the user `@test:example.com` into room `!320j90mf0394f:example.com`.

**Note:**

- This requires the bot to be a server admin.
- This only works for rooms on the same server.

## User Information

### Respond to "users" with Full List of Server Users

[View JSON](respond-users-list.json)

When someone sends the text "users", they receive an HTML message containing all the current users on the server. If your server has many users, this paginates and sends messages with 25 users per message.

**Notes:**

- This requires admin privileges.
- If there are many users, the bot may send multiple messages due to message size limits.

![Respond to "users" with User List](respond-users-list.png)

---

### Respond to "whois \<user_id\>" with Information about the User's Session

[View JSON](respond-whois.json)

Lists out the user's session info, including IP address, last seen time, and user agent. Useful for finding out more about a specific user on your server.

**Notes:**

- This requires admin privileges.
- If the user has many sessions, the message may be too large to send in one piece.

![Respond to "whois" with User Session Info](respond-whois.png)

---

### Respond to "rooms \<user_id\>" with User's Rooms

[View JSON](respond-rooms.json)

Responds to "rooms \<user_id\>" with that user's rooms. If the message is just "rooms", it responds with a list of all rooms the server is participating in.

**Notes:**

- If there are many rooms, the message may be too large to send in one piece.
- This only works for users on the current server.

![Respond to "rooms" with Room List](respond-rooms.png)

---

### Respond to "room_users" with Current Room's Users

[View JSON](respond-room-users.json)

Lists the users participating in the current room.

**Note:** If there are many users in the room, the message may be too large to send.

## Advanced Features

### Use Function Node to Run Any Command

[View JSON](custom-redact-function-node.json)

If there isn't a node for something you want to do, you can use a function node to manually execute commands. For example, you can redact events (remove messages).

**Instructions:**

- Use the function node to write custom commands using the `matrix-js-sdk` client.
- Make sure to catch any errors in your function node to prevent Node-RED from crashing.

To view the available functions, check out the [`client.ts` file from `matrix-js-sdk`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/master/src/client.ts).

![Use Function Node to Run Commands](custom-redact-function-node.png)

---

### Sending Typing Events to a Room

[View JSON](send-typing-events.json)

You can indicate to a room that the bot is typing and also cancel the typing event. This can be useful for making bots feel more interactive (e.g., show typing while requesting an API endpoint).

![Sending Typing Events](send-typing-events.png)

---

### Download & Store All Received Files/Images

[View JSON](store-received-files.json)

Downloads received files/images. If the file is encrypted, it will decrypt it for you. The decrypt node downloads the file; otherwise, you need to use an HTTP Request node to download the file.

**Instructions:**

- You may need to edit the storage directory for this to work.
- By default, files are saved in a `downloads` folder in the Node-RED directory.
- Ensure that Node-RED has permission to write to the specified directory.

![Download & Store Received Files](store-received-files.png)

---

### Fetch event by eventId and roomId

[View JSON](get-event.json)

Fetch an event from Matrix by eventId and roomId

**Instructions:**

- Change the inject node to contain a proper eventId and roomId (topic)
- Inject the payload and you should see the result contain the event data

![get-event.png](get-event.png)

---

### Paginate related events to a given eventId

[View JSON](fetch-event-relations.json)

Paginate through the related events to a given eventId. Related events being reactions, thread messages, message modifications, message removals, etc. This outputs once per iterated page.

If you would rather have it output one massive list at the end of pagination use this flow:
[View Aggregated Flow JSON](fetch-event-relations-aggregated.json)


**Instructions:**

- Change the inject node to contain a proper eventId and roomId (topic)
- Inject the payload and you should see the result contain a list of related events for the given eventId

![fetch-event-relations.png](fetch-event-relations.png)

---

### Mark all received events as read

[View JSON](mark-all-read.json)

---

### Fetch user info by userId

[View JSON](get-user.json)

Note this only works for users that the bot shares a room with. It will attempt to fetch the user from local storage first and if not found will query the server for the data.

### Set user avatar using URL

[View JSON](set-avatar-from-url.json)

Inject a URL to an image and Node-RED will fetch the contents, upload to matrix, then set the user avatar to the new mxc_url.

This is a good example of how to use the upload file node.
